##👨🏻‍💻 Customer Behavior Analytics – Portfolio Project

This repository contains my Customer Behavior Analytics portfolio project, where I analyze customer data to understand purchasing patterns, customer segments, and key business drivers. The focus of this project is to demonstrate what I worked on, how I approached the analysis, and the tools I used, following an end-to-end analytics workflow.

The project reflects how data analysts typically work in real business environments — from raw data handling to insight generation and reporting.
