# Customer Behavior Analytics – Portfolio Project

This repository documents my **Customer Behavior Analytics portfolio project**, where I worked on analyzing customer data to understand purchasing behavior, customer segments, and key business drivers. The project is structured to reflect an **end-to-end data analytics workflow**, similar to how analytics tasks are handled in real business environments.

The focus of this README is to clearly outline **what I worked on, how the analysis was performed, and the tools used**, rather than explaining concepts or providing tutorials.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:

- Apply Python, SQL, and Power BI in a realistic analytics scenario
- Practice end-to-end data analysis from raw data to insights
- Analyze customer behavior and transaction patterns
- Build a strong portfolio project for GitHub, LinkedIn, and interviews

## What I Did in This Project

### Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python)

- Loaded raw customer and transaction datasets
- Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent records
- Performed data transformations and feature creation
- Prepared clean, analysis-ready datasets

**Tools:** Python (Pandas, NumPy)

---

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyzed customer demographics and purchase behavior
- Explored order frequency, revenue distribution, and trends
- Identified patterns, correlations, and outliers in the data

**Tools:** Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

---

### Business Analysis Using SQL

- Designed tables to simulate real-world business transactions
- Wrote SQL queries to analyze:
  - Customer segmentation
  - Repeat purchases and loyalty behavior
  - Revenue contribution by customer groups
- Answered business-driven analytical questions

**Tools:** SQL

---

### Dashboarding & Visualization (Power BI)

- Built an interactive Power BI dashboard
- Visualized key KPIs and customer segments
